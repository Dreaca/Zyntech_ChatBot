    <pattern>WHAT ARE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS?</pattern>
    <template>
      Obsessions are unwanted and distressing thoughts, images, or urges that repeatedly enter your mind. Compulsions are behaviors or mental acts performed to alleviate the distress caused by obsessions. These behaviors are often excessive and not connected to any realistic threat.

    <pattern>HOW IS OCD TREATED?</pattern>
    <template>
      OCD can be managed through therapy and, if necessary, medication. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), particularly Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is an effective approach. ERP involves gradual exposure to triggers without performing compulsions. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may also be prescribed by a healthcare provider.
