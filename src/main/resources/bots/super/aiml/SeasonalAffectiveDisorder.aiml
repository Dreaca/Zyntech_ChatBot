      Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs at a specific time of year, typically during the fall and winter months when there is less sunlight. SAD can lead to symptoms such as low mood, fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, and a lack of interest in activities. Seeking professional help is important for managing SAD.

      The exact cause of Seasonal Affective Disorder is not fully understood, but it's thought to be related to changes in light exposure and its impact on the body's internal clock (circadian rhythm) and neurotransmitter levels. Reduced sunlight during the winter months may contribute to the development of SAD.
